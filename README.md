# MuCity - Community Integration Hub 🌐

## Problem Description
In our rapidly growing cities and villages, there's often a lack of centralized platforms that connect residents with essential services, resources, and each other. MuCity aims to bridge this gap by creating a comprehensive web application that serves as a one-stop hub for all community needs.

## Motivation
The inspiration behind MuCity stems from the desire to enhance community living. By consolidating services like local businesses, emergency contacts, event calendars, and public announcements into one accessible platform, MuCity aims to foster a stronger sense of community and make essential information readily available to all residents. I believe that a connected community is a thriving community.

## Features
- **Integrated Local Businesses:** Connect residents with local businesses, promoting community support.
- **Emergency Contacts:** Provide quick access to emergency services and contacts for immediate assistance.
- **Community Calendar:** A centralized calendar for local events, fostering community engagement.
- **Public Announcements:** Keep residents informed about important news and updates.
- **Interactive Maps:** Navigate through the community with ease using interactive maps.
